IfElseComparisonsAndLogicalOperators

This project demonstrates the use of if-else statements, comparison operators, and logical operators in C#. It includes examples that check conditions based on user input, such as age and student status, to show different cases in decision-making.
Project Structure

The Program.cs file contains examples of:

    If-Else Statements: Basic decision-making structures.
    Comparison Operators: (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) to compare values.
    Logical Operators: (&&, ||, !) to combine multiple conditions.

Code Examples

In this project, we cover:

    Checking if the user is an adult based on age.
    Identifying whether the user is a student and adjusting the message based on both age and student status.
    Using comparison operators to detect specific conditions (e.g., if the user is exactly 18 years old).

Example Output

    Enter your age: 20
    Are you a student? (yes/no): yes
    You are an adult.
    You are an adult student.
    You are not exactly 18 years old.

How to Run

    Clone the repository.
    Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
    Run the Program.cs file and follow the prompts in the console to see the examples of if-else usage and logical operations.

Purpose

This project is aimed at beginners who want to understand how to use if-else structures, comparison, and logical operators in C# for decision-making.
